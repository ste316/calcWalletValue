# Calculate Wallet Value is a program to instantly see how your cryptocurrency portfolio is performing.

1. ## Prerequisites:
    * [Download a python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/), suggested python version >= 3.9
    * Download all dependencies
      * move to the folder of the project
      * run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * Insert all your assets and their amount in input.csv
    * Fill settings.json with your preferences
        * currency supported: "EUR" and "USD", needs to be uppercase 
            * other currencies may be supported, have not been tested
        * <i>path</i> field will be the parent folder where the data will be saved

        * provider can be "cg" for CoinGecko or "cmc" for CoinMarketCap
        * You can choose between CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap api
            * CoinGecko api is free and you do NOT need any api key, see [plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) and
            [limits](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)
            * CoinMarketCap it's free too, but you need to [sign in](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/login/) and get an api key

            #### CoinMarketCap is lightning faster and easy to use, but you have less privacy.
            #### CoinGecko is slower and a bit more complicated to use, but you don't have to create any account or fill your information anywhere, yet more privacy.
            #### Both solutions are supported, make your choice.
            in case you choose CoinMarketCap, make sure to fill the api key in <i>CMC_key</i> field
